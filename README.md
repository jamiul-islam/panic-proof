# Panic Proof ‚úåÔ∏è

## A gamified AI-powered disaster preparedness and emergency response app

### Why Panic Proof ‚úåÔ∏è?

In an increasingly unpredictable world where natural and man-made disasters are becoming more frequent and severe, being prepared can make all the difference. Panic Proof was born out of the need to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly tool that empowers individuals and communities to take proactive measures before disaster strikes, respond effectively during emergencies, and recover more quickly in the aftermath.

Our mission is simple: to save lives and reduce suffering by making disaster preparedness accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise or prior knowledge of emergency management.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamiul-islam/panic-proof.git
cd panic-proof
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or if you prefer bun for faster installation
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
# Create a .env.local file in the root directory with:
